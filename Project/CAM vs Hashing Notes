+ Hashing
	+ 16 to 5 CRC
	+ Takes 3 - 4 cycles
	+ Bucket Size at least 2
		+ Beauty of 2 : NMRU == LRU !
			+ Easy implementation of LRU : Just write 0 1 or 1 0 into respective LRU bits of the 2 key-value mappings of that bucket

+ CAM
	+ May not need LRU per se, but can be NMRU or a simpler variant
