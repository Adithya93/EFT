The switch is partitioned into four subsystems:
    1. receive port
    2. transmit port
    3. forwarding ("switch fabric")
    4. table

Receive port functions include:
    checking that received frames are valid
    discard of invalid frames
    interfaces to the forwarding subsystem
    buffering of frames
    receive interface to PHY
	clock domain boundary

Transmit port functions include:
    prepend preamble and SFD to frames being transmitted
    maintaining interframe gap for transmitted frames
    interfaces to the forwarding subsystem
    buffering of frames, including queue management given an output-queueing
		architecture for the switch
    transmit interface to PHY
	clock domain boundary

Forwarding functions include:
    making forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses in frames,
        using info from the table subsystem
    receive port to transmit port data paths, i.e moving each frame from a
		receive port to the appropriate transmit port(s)
    interfaces to the table subsystem
    interfaces to the ports

Table functions include:
    managing the forwarding table
	performing lookups into the table for forwarding decisions and the learning
		process
    adding and deleting table entries ("learning" process)
    interfaces to the forwarding subsystem
