Here is the timeline with checkpoint / milestone dates as of 6 Feb:

    o overall high-level design complete: 21 Feb  (DETAILED DESIGN REVIEW)
        includes subsystem decomposition into functional blocks and definition
          of inter-subsystem and intra-subsystem interfaces
        assumes that some VHDL coding and simulation of functional blocks will
          have begun
       **** specifics to be included in presentations:
                - block diagram of subsystem decompostion into entities
                - interface definitions (what signals cross the interface,
                   what are the timing relationships of the signals that
                   cross the interface, how does the interface work (from the
                   perspective of the elements on either side)
                - VHDL code for one entity per subsystem, to be compiled
                   as part of the presentation
	o low-level design progress report: 7 Mar 
		- assess status before start of spring break
		- deliverables TBD
    o individual subsystem low-level design complete: 23 Mar (DETAILED DESIGN REVIEW)
        - includes implementation and checkout of subsystem elements
        - includes elements running on the DE2 boards
    o subsystem integration and test complete: 6 Apr
    o begin complete system integration and test: 6 Apr

    o final demonstration and reports:  (during final exam week)
